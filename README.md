# GraphQL account system

This project is an simple account system practice using GraphQL

## introduction

GraphQL is an trendy structure that it is faster, more flextible than RESTful API's, because user can define the fetching data type which can prevent overfetching.

### `Postman`

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a powerful tool for backend structure testing. It allows us to test our code without building the cliend side. In this project, we will us query and mutation on the Postman. The reason I choose to use Postman, instead of GraphQL playground is that we want to put the token in the header for the authorization. 

Finally, after cloning the repository, running `yarn` & `yarn start`, and navigate to [ http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000), you can play with this project.
